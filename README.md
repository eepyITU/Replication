# ChittyChat

eepy chat service.

To run and use Chitty-Chat:

1. Open two seperate terminals
2. In the first terminal, start the server by running the command 'go run server/server.go'
3. In the second terminal, enter the sever as a client by running the command 'go run client/client.go -username <username>', where <username> encapsulates your chosen username.
4. If wanting to, open a third terminal, and run the same command with a new username, to send messages from both to the server.
5. To let a client exit the chat, go to the client terminal, and simply press ctrl + c.
6. To close the server entirely, go to the server terminal, and press ctrl + c.
